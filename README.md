# Bobbolax

While it may sound like an excellent name for a laxative, Bobbolax is actually a jQuery plugin to help with Parallax effects.  Bobbolax allows you to pass in a series of keyframes.  Based on these keyframes, it will automatically animate your elements as you scroll through the page.

This was developed mostly as a POC, and as such, is far from full-featured, nor is it very thoroughly tested.  It is unlikely that I will be updating this on my own, but if you log issues, I'll likely fix them.
