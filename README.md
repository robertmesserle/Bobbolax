Bobbolax
========

While it may sound like an excellent name for a laxative, Bobbolax is actually a jQuery plugin to help with Parallax effects.  Bobbolax allows you to pass in a series of keyframes.  Based on these keyframes, it will automatically animate your elements as you scroll through the page.

Not a whole lot is done with this yet, but feel free to check back for more updates.
